* Python server

To start the server from the current directory at =http://0.0.0.0:8000/= use

#+begin_src sh
  python3 -m http.server
#+end_src

* Emacs server

The following is based on a StackOverflow [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/2515][answer]]. To start a server out of emacs
you use the following commands

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'simple-httpd)
;; set root folder for httpd server
;; (setq httpd-root "<path/to/foo.html>")
(setq httpd-root "/home/aez/Documents/presentations/phyloseminar-2022/images/algorithm")
#+end_src

Then call =httpd-start= to actually start the server.

http://localhost:8080/

You may need to edit the HTML file first...

Once you have this set up and the page open in your browser, use =skewer-repl=
to start the REPL and =console.log('hello there')= to test it is actually
working.
